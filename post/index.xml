      <description>A while ago, I wanted to automate the lights in my house. There were several guides for controlling cheap radio outlets with a Raspberry Pi and webapp. I ordered the parts and set it up over a weekend, but using a webapp to turn lights on and off was cumbersome if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t already sitting at my computer.
I had recently picked up a Pebble 2, so I took it a step further and wrote an Android App and Pebble App to control the lights from my phone and my watch.</description>

      <description>I have a little Linux VPS server that I use for various things. It runs some of the sites I&amp;rsquo;ve made over the years, and runs a Deluge, which if your not familiar, is a torrent client. It&amp;rsquo;s useful for seeding Linux ISOs and sharing files and whatnot.
A few months back I was going to update the server to the next Ubuntu version, when I noticed that my user didn&amp;rsquo;t have sudo rights.</description>
